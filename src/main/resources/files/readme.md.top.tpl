# MicroProfile generated Applications

MicroProfile Starter has generated 2 MicroProfile applications for you.

There are 2 projects generated so that the examples for the Rest Client and/or JWT Auth specification are more realistic in the sense that they actually call an endpoint within another service.

. In the `main` directory, you can find an application with the major parts of the application.
. In the `secondary` directory, you can find some endpoints which will be called by code within the main application.

Have a look in the `readme.md` file in each directory which describes how each project can be built and run.
